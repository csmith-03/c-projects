## CSCI 340 Project 1 - Linux Processes
### Channing Smith

##### How to build and run program:
change directory (cd) into the project folder, type "make", and then type "./project1"

##### Issues
- Struggled to figure out how to store information about the process.
- Tossed a bunch of ideas around like a 2D array, and an array of structures.
- Struggled to format the output - especially the name of each process. Also ran into some problems at one point with our program printing the information about the same process multiple times.  
- Overall, it works now... :)
